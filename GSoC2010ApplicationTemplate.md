# Introduction #

We are basing our required application template for students on the prior GSoC experience of our committers. Therefore, we are looking for high-quality applications that provide clear details of the proposed project using the following template:

  * Abstract
  * Discussion
    * Benefits to the Community
    * Project description
      * Work break-down structure
        * Stage description
        * Milestone
        * Deliverable
        * Mini scenario/demo
        * Estimated duration
      * Proposed resources
  * About Me
    * Contact details
  * References

# Details #

We prefer clear and concise applications. Our advice is to make several revisions of your application paying close attention to quality and detail. We encourage you to communicate frequently with us during your application so we can help in the process.

For an example, please check out the accepted application of one of our committers for GSoC'08:

Upon finishing your project we expect a high-level description of your output in our wiki. For an example please take a look at the contributions from the alternate project of one of our committers for GSoC'09:
